        <h3>What is Telehealth? </h3>
        <p className="primaryText">
          Telehealth refers to the provision of healthcare services using
          electronic communication, telecommunications, information technology,
          or other comparable methods between a healthcare professional and a
          patient who are not physically located in the same place. This is a
          convenient way for you to receive healthcare services from your
          provider in various locations, including your own home.
        </p>
        <h3>Telehealth Usage: </h3>
        <p>
          Telehealth is utilized for providing clinical health care services,
          including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care; health education;
          and public health administration. Telehealth may be utilized for
          various purposes, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Telehealth is utilized for providing clinical health care services,
            including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care; health
            education; and public health administration. Telehealth may be
            utilized for various purposes, such as:
          </li>
          <li>
            Storing and forwarding diagnostic images, sound and video files to a
            healthcare professional; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Communicating through audio or video conferencing and/or data
            communications between you and a healthcare provider.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Privacy Protection:</h3>
        <p>
          The FiveCornersRx Service will implement network and software security
          protocols to safeguard the privacy and security of health information
          and data. These protocols will be employed in all technologies and
          electronic systems used to provide telehealth services. Furthermore,
          measures will be taken to protect your protected health information
          and data to ensure its integrity against corruption, whether
          intentional or unintentional. Your interactions with your healthcare
          provider are confidential, and they will not be recorded.
        </p>
        <h3>Benefits of Telemedicine:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Telehealth provides a more convenient and efficient way to access
            medical care and treatment, as you don't have to physically visit a
            clinic or hospital to see your healthcare provider.
          </li>
          <li>
            Managing your interactions with your healthcare provider is easier
            and more efficient
          </li>
          <li>
            You can avoid the risk of exposure to illnesses by not coming into
            contact with other sick people in a clinic or hospital.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Potential Risks of Telehealth:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Telehealth may feel different and make it challenging for you to
            communicate with and provide adequate information to your healthcare
            provider, as it is outside the typical healthcare setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your healthcare provider may not be able to diagnose or treat you
            due to the need for physical tests and a close physical examination,
            which cannot be conducted remotely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Missed signs and symptoms that require emergency medical treatment
            or further medical testing may occur due to the inability to
            physically examine you, and your healthcare provider may not be able
            to provide medical treatment for your specific condition through
            telehealth, necessitating alternative care.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technological failures may cause disruptions in your tele-visit with
            your healthcare provider or delays in your evaluation and treatment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technological failures may cause diagnostic images or specimens to
            be distorted as a result of electronic transmission issues,
            unauthorized access to your information, or loss of information due
            to technology failures. People nearby may also overhear confidential
            information if you are not in a private location during your
            tele-visit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your healthcare provider's treatment options may be limited by
            regulatory requirements, particularly related to certain
            prescriptions, in some jurisdictions.
          </li>
          <li>
            You acknowledge and understand the risks and benefits associated
            with telehealth, which is the medical care and treatment provided to
            you through the platform of FiveCornersRx by healthcare "Providers."

          </li>
          <li>
            You understand that telehealth may offer potential benefits, but
            there are no guarantees that your condition will be cured or
            improved and, in some instances, may even worsen.
          </li>
          <p>
            By clicking "AGREE," you acknowledge that you have read and
            understood the terms and conditions of live video telehealth visits

          Asynchronous Telehealth is a type of telehealth service that allows
          you to interact with your healthcare provider in real-time through
          audio or video technology, such as live phone calls or
          videoconferencing. It enables healthcare providers to diagnose and
          consult with patients in real-time when face-to-face contact or live
          communication is not possible or necessary.
        </p>
        <h5>How Does FiveCornersRx Offer Asynchronous Telehealth? </h5>
        <p>
          FiveCornersRx provides Asynchronous Telehealth services through its
          platform, which utilizes secure, encrypted video conferencing
          technology to enable real-time interactions between patients and

            It removes the need for in-person visits, saving you time and
            reducing your travel costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can attend appointments from wherever you are, as long as you

            treatment.
          </li>
          <li>
            You acknowledge that telehealth services are subject to the same

            You acknowledge and agree that your healthcare information may be
            shared in the following circumstances
            <ul className={styles.discList}>
              <li>When a valid court order is issued for medical records.</li>
              <li>
                When there is suspected abuse, neglect, or domestic violence
                that needs to be reported.
              </li>
              <li>
                When there is a need to prevent or reduce a serious threat to

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Possible risks should be considered before consenting to the use of
          Asynchronous Telehealth. These risks include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The possibility of delayed visits due to technological deficiencies,
            disruptions, or failures that may necessitate rescheduling the visit
            with the healthcare provider.
          </li>
          <li>
            The possibility of security protocols failure, which may result in
            the breach of personal health information privacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            The inability of healthcare providers to fully assess a patient's
            condition without access to their complete medical history.
          </li>
          <li>
            The likelihood of negative outcomes such as drug interactions and
            allergic reactions, increasing as healthcare providers do not have
            access to a patient's complete medical records.
          </li>
          <li>
            Asynchronous telehealth services are not emergency services, and
            personal data is not monitored at all times. In case of a medical
            emergency, patients should immediately call 911.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The healthcare provider has sole discretion over the care received by
          the patient, with no guarantee of diagnosis, treatment, or
          prescription.
          <br />
          Legislative restrictions in some states may make Asynchronous
          Telehealth unavailable.
          <br />
          By accepting the Asynchronous Telehealth Consent, patients acknowledge
          and agree to the following terms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            They have read and understood the risks and benefits of using
            telehealth services through FiveCornersRx's platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            The same privacy rights apply during asynchronous telehealth
            consultations as they would during an in-person visit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Asynchronous telehealth may involve the electronic transmission of
            personal health information to healthcare providers located in other
            areas, including out of state.
          </li>
          <li>
            While anticipated benefits from asynchronous telehealth can be
            expected, no results can be guaranteed or assured.
          </li>
          <li>
            All information submitted to FiveCornersRx via text message or
            entered by the healthcare provider in the FiveCornersRx platform
            will become part of the patient's medical record.
          </li>
          <li>
            Patients can withdraw or withhold their consent at any time by
            emailing FiveCornersRx.
          </li>
          <li>This consent is not a condition of purchase.</li>
          <li>
            Patients' healthcare information may be shared in accordance with
            the FiveCornersRx Privacy Policy and the regulations or laws of the
            state or territory where they are located.
          </li>
          <li>
            Patients agree and understand that their healthcare information may
            be shared in specific circumstances, such as when a valid court
            order is issued for medical records or reporting suspected abuse,
            neglect, or domestic violence.
