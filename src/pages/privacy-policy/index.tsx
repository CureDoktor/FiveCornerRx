        <h3>3. Information Gathered from Social Media </h3> and Other Content
        Platforms If you choose to interact with us on social media platforms
        such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or others, we may collect certain
        information from you. This may include your name, email address, and any

          If you sign up for one of our promotions or submit information to us
          through social media, we may also collect your information.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Information Obtained from Other Sources</h3> We may receive
        additional information from third-party sources such as physicians,
        medical professionals, and pharmacies, with whom we collaborate to offer
        you our services and their healthcare services. We may also obtain
        information from sub-contractors in technical, advertising networks,
        analytics providers, and search information providers.
        <h3>5. Protected Health Information</h3>
        <p>
          By setting up an account with FiveCornersRx, you establish a customer
          relationship that allows you to access and utilize the features of the
          Site Offerings as a user. You may provide personal information such as
          your name, email address, mailing/billing address, and telephone
          number to FiveCornersRx as part of this relationship. This information
          is not considered “protected health information” or “medical
          information”.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, when you request Prescription Medications or certain
          FiveCornersRx Products, you may also provide health or medical
          information that is subject to protection under applicable laws, such
          as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
          (HIPAA) and related regulations. FiveCornersRx is not a “covered
          entity” under HIPAA, but our Healthcare Providers are covered
          entities, and we may be a “business associate” of the Healthcare
          Providers in some cases. It is important to note that HIPAA may not
          apply to all of your transactions or communications with
          FiveCornersRx. If we are deemed a “business associate,” we may be
          subject to certain provisions of HIPAA regarding “protected health
          information” (PHI) that you provide to the Healthcare Providers. Any
          medical or health information that is subject to specific protections
          under applicable state laws, together with PHI, is defined as
          “Protected Information” and will only be used and disclosed in
          accordance with such applicable laws. However, any information that
          does not constitute Protected Information may be used or disclosed in
          any manner permitted under this Privacy Policy. Protected Information
          does not include information that has been de-identified in accordance
          with applicable laws.

        <h3>ONLINE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Online Analytics To better understand and improve the experience of
            our users, we may use third-party web analytics services like Google
            Analytics and Cartstack on our Services. These services collect
            usage information through cookies and similar tools, allowing us to
            analyze unique user interactions across multiple browsers or
            devices, as well as provide certain features to enhance user
            experience. Additionally, these tools help us engage in auditing,
            research, and reporting, and assist with fraud prevention. If you
            have a Google account with personalized advertising enabled, we may
            also gather and analyze engagement information from the various
            devices you use to access the Services using Google Signals. To opt

            Mobile Advertising When you use our mobile applications, you may
            receive in-application advertisements that are tailored to you. To
            deliver these ads, we may use third-party service providers or
            conduct mobile application analytics. Each operating system provides
            its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored
            in-application advertisements. For example, iOS for Apple phones,
            Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices all
            have their own settings for controlling personalized in-application
            advertisements. If you wish to opt out of tailored in-application
            advertisements, you should contact the platform provider for further
            details on how to do so. You can review the support materials or
            device settings for the respective operating systems to opt out of
            tailored in-app advertisements.

            Notice Concerning Do Not Track Some web browsers have a privacy
            preference setting called Do Not Track (DNT) that enables users to
            limit the web browser's ability to collect information about them.
            We are dedicated to providing you with meaningful choices about the
            information collected on our website for third-party purposes, which
            is why we offer the opt-out mechanisms mentioned above. However, at
            present, we do not acknowledge or respond to browser-initiated DNT
            signals. For more information on DNT, please visit this website.

        <p>
          We understand that your privacy is important to you, and we take it
          seriously. We want to make sure that you are aware of how we share and
          disclose your information. Here are the ways we may do so for our
          business purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Affiliates and Subsidiaries. To provide you with the best possible
            products and services, we may share the information we collect
            within our group of companies, which includes our affiliates,
            subsidiaries, and ultimate holding company. This helps us deliver
            consistent and enhanced products, services, and customer experience
            across the board.
          </li>
          <li>
            Health Care Providers and Services. Your health is our top priority,
            which is why we may share your information with healthcare
            providers. This is necessary to schedule and fulfill appointments,
            provide healthcare services through our platform, transmit your
            messages to your intended recipients, and for other treatment,
            payment, or healthcare operations purposes as requested by you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Service Providers. We use select third-party service providers to
            perform various services on our behalf. These services may include

            customer service, shipping and fulfillment, data storage, IT and
            security, fraud prevention, payment processing, and auditing and
            legal services. We may also use healthcare organizations,
            pharmacies, and other third parties to support our business or to
            administer and support our services. We take measures to ensure that
            these entities follow the same privacy and security practices as us,
            and that they only use your information to perform the agreed-upon
            services.

            information when we have a good faith belief that such access,
            retention, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
            safety and security of our users or the public, to enforce our Terms
            of Use or other agreements with you, or to investigate and prevent
            fraud or other illegal activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Business Transactions. As we continue to grow and develop our
            business, we may enter into mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, or
            other business transactions. In such transactions, we may transfer
            user information, including customer information, to third parties.
            If we transfer user information as part of a business transaction,
            we will ensure that such information is transferred subject to
            appropriate confidentiality, privacy, and security measures and in
            compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

            publicly may be accessible by other users and third-party search
            engines.

            specifically directed us to or with your consent.
